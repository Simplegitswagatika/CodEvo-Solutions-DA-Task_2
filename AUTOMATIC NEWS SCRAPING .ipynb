Police were called to Barnard Road in Gorton at about 23:20 BST on Sunday after reports three people had been stabbed. The woman died at the scene while a 17-year-old girl and a 64-year-old man were taken to hospital for treatment. Initial inquiries suggest the suspect, aged 22, was known to the victims, Greater Manchester Police said.\n",

The injured girl and man suffered \"serious stab wounds\" in the attack and their condition is \"believed to be life-threatening at this time\", the police said. Barnard Road has been closed off while officers investigate behind a police cordon. Three forensic tents have been put up, one in a garden, one in the road, and one at a property in the street. Plain-clothed officers have been seen knocking on doors, while others in white overalls and protective clothing have been seen in the road. One person, who lives within the cordon, told BBC Radio Manchester he woke up to hear a \"lot of screaming and noises\". Another person said \"you don't expect to see such a large police scene\" in the area, while another said it was unexpected for a \"nice, quiet\" place.\n",

He said the investigation was in its \"very early stages\", and appealed for anyone with any information about the attack to come forward. This included anyone in the surrounding area near Barnard Road at about 23:00 BST, he added. “We understand that the local community and further afield across Greater Manchester will be rightly shocked and concerned after waking up and hearing this tragic news this morning. “Our thoughts remain with those affected and their loved ones at this difficult time.

      "Content: Gaza protesters descend on Chicago for Democratic convention\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters Protest groups suggest tens of thousands could march in Chicago\n",
      "\n",
      "The Democratic National Convention kicks off on Monday in Chicago, in what is expected to be a celebration of Kamala Harris's nomination as presidential candidate following Joe Biden's exit from the race. However protests over the war in Gaza, led by Democrats from the party's left, threaten to disrupt the unity message. Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected near the convention site to show their opposition to Mr Biden's policies towards Israel and Gaza, from which Ms Harris, his vice-president, has not deviated. There will also be events organised by pro-Israel groups, including a \"hostage square\" intended to draw attention to the plight of those who remain in Hamas hands. Relatives of hostages are also expected to attend the convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Demonstrators gathered in Chicago on Sunday\n",
      "\n",
      "The four-day Democrat spectacle will culminate on Thursday with Ms Harris giving a primetime speech that will be watched by millions of Americans, fewer than three months before election day. President Biden, the former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and a list of actors and entertainers will give speeches at the United Center in Chicago. It comes a little over a month after Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination in Milwaukee, just days after surviving an assassination attempt and as Democrats were in disarray over 81-year-old Mr Biden's weakness as a candidate. Since then the momentum of the race has shifted significantly, with Ms Harris's entry to the race and her running-mate choice of Tim Walz, Minnesota's governor, jolting enthusiasm and pushing them slightly ahead of Trump and his running mate JD Vance in national polls. What remains unclear is how the Harris campaign and the Democratic Party will tackle policy towards Israel and the conflict in Gaza. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza intending to destroy Hamas after the group attacked southern Israel on 7 October. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry says more than 40,000 people have since been killed in the campaign in the strip. Ms Harris has not released a clear policy on Gaza and Israel. She has, however, called for a ceasefire and for the respectful treatment of protesters at her rallies. She also recently said \"far too many\" civilians had been killed but did not back a weapons embargo on Israel as some progressives have called for. The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'uncommitted'\n",
      "\n",
      "Opposition to the Biden administration's handling of the conflict caused more than 750,000 people to vote \"uncommitted\" - rather than for any specific candidate - during the Democratic presidential primary earlier this year. While the energy of that campaign has ebbed slightly, the presence of that vote in key swing states such as Michigan would still be felt at the convention. Only three dozen delegates will represent the \"uncommitted\" vote and they will be greatly outnumbers by the more than 4,500 backing Ms Harris. However, they speak for hundreds of thousands of unsatisfied voters. In interviews, they said that they intended to spend the convention pressing the Harris campaign and their party to act more forcefully on Gaza. \"We know that this is not a small endeavour. We are challenging a status quo US policy of the past 40 years, and it won't shift overnight,\" said Samuel Doten, a Democratic organiser and \"uncommitted\" delegate. Several of the delegates said they hoped to convince fellow Democrats to sign a letter demanding Ms Harris and the party support a ceasefire and arms embargo against Israel. They said they were not trying to spoil the convention or the election, but were rather pushing the party to adopt a policy popular among Democratic voters. \"There are thousands of voters across the US who voted 'uncommitted', so it feels like a huge responsibility for us to present their wishes and to make sure that their voices are being heard and amplified in this party,\" said Adrita Rahman, who will attend the DNC for the first time as an \"uncommitted\" delegate.\n",

      "Joel Quince described being thirsty, hungry and exhausted while working on a Scottish trawler\n",
      "\n",
      "Dozens of workers from around the world may have been trafficked into the UK to work for a small family-owned Scottish fishing firm, a BBC investigation has revealed. Thirty-five men from the Philippines, Ghana, India and Sri Lanka were recognised as victims of modern slavery by the Home Office after being referred to it between 2012 and 2020. The workers were employed by TN Trawlers and its sister companies, owned by the Nicholson family, based in the small town of Annan on the southern coast of Scotland. The TN Group denied any allegation of modern slavery or human trafficking and said its workers were well treated and well paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company was the focus of two long-running criminal investigations but no cases of human trafficking or modern slavery have come to trial, although some of the men waited years to give evidence. While TN Trawlers’ lead director, Thomas Nicholson, was under active investigation, TN Group companies continued recruiting new employees from across the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joel Quince had been expecting to earn a good income in the UK\n",
      "\n",
      "Experienced fisherman Joel Quince was 28 when he landed at Heathrow Airport in 2012, thrilled to have secured a job as a deckhand with TN trawlers. Joel had a young family back home in the Philippines, thousands of miles away. He had been expecting to earn a good income working in the UK. He was to be paid $1,012 (£660) a month for a 48-hour week. He caught a bus from London to Carlisle, where, he says, he was picked up by the owner’s son, Tom Nicholson Jr. “On our way to go to the boat he told us: 'You have to give me your documents' - so without hesitation I gave all my documents to them,” he said. Joel says he was then taken straight to the fishing ground to start working. But he was surprised to find that his boat was the Philomena rather than the Mattanja, which was the only vessel he was authorised to work on under the terms of his visa. “This was already something fishy for me,” he said He claims that instead of the 48-hour week he had been told about, he was working 18 hours a day, seven days a week while the Philomena was out fishing. On his monthly wage of £660, it meant Joel was earning less than the UK minimum wage – although at that time there was no legal requirement to pay it to fishermen like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alamy The Philomena was one of the company's vessels\n",
      "\n",
      "Joel was one of about 30 seafarers who arrived in the UK to join TN Trawlers between 2011 and 2013, mostly from the Philippines. They joined dredgers trawling for scallops along the UK coastline. These dredgers, built in the 1970s and 80s, work by towing metal nets along the seabed. They scrape up shellfish, as well as stones and bycatch – the other marine life which gets caught in the nets. Deckhands throw back the stones and pack the scallops in ice below deck. Several of the men the BBC spoke to had little or no fishing experience. All describe working shift patterns as gruelling as Joel’s or worse. Joel said he struggled to get up to go to work because he was so exhausted – but he didn’t complain because his colleagues were also suffering. “If I stop working, there’s three people suffering, not getting their rest, because the operation keeps continuing. They won’t stop.” He said there was not enough drinking water on board the vessels, and the crew were reduced to eating tomatoes from the stores to wet their throats. He also said that on one occasion a skipper threw an empty Coke can at the crew. All the men the BBC spoke to described shortages of proper clothing, food and water.\n",

      "Jaype Rubi was a young Filipino when he worked on board the TN dredger Sea Lady in 2012. “Picking up and throwing out rocks is really tiring,” he said. “The boat had CCTV, so the skipper could watch us. If we stop, he'd pull down the window and say: ‘Why are you resting’?” Jaype said it was “super cold” and there was not enough food. When he spoke to his mum on the phone, he started crying. “I said: 'I want to go home because it's a nightmare working on that boat'.” Jaype said he was subjected to verbal abuse and was treated “like a slave\". Other men said that, despite arriving in the UK on 48-hour transit visa, they were told to work onshore in the TN yard at Annan, in breach of their visa entitlement. One man, Jovito Abiero, told the BBC he was sometimes sent to the home of the company owner Tom Nicholson to do gardening. On 22 August 2012, Joel was aboard the Philomena off the coast of Northern Ireland during rough weather. He was fixing a broken link in the metal nets when the towing bar swung up. He leapt out of the way - but fell and hit his head on the deck. His crew mates estimated he was unconscious for up to 15 minutes.\n",

We continue fishing',” said Joel. Joel was given paracetamol by the skipper and his head was bandaged. The Philomena didn’t turn around and head for the port of Troon in Ayrshire until 11 hours after the accident. Joel got off the Philomena, never to return. He found support at the Fishermen’s Mission, a harbourside charity that supports seafarers. At that time the mission was run by two sisters, Paula Daly and Karen Burston, who helped Joel get medical help. They had been hearing rumours about TN boats for some time. “In 2012, it became really quite abundantly clear that we were getting the same message from quite a few different crew,” said Paula. “There were so many things that were so wrong,” added Karen.\n",

Tom Nicholson and TN Trawlers were ordered to pay £473,000 under proceeds of crime laws. They were also ordered to pay almost £150,000 in fines and costs after the Maritime and Coastguard Agency found a string of defects and safety breaches on vessels between 2009 and 2011. A 2012 police briefing, seen by the BBC, also noted six Filipino fishermen swam ashore from TN boats and complained of mistreatment. That year, police in Dumfries and Galloway launched Operation Alto, an investigation into human trafficking and labour abuse at TN Trawlers. Eighteen former TN Trawlers employees – including Joel – passed into the Home Office’s National Referral Mechanism, a system which identifies and supports victims of human trafficking.\n",

Gideon told the BBC his wages were diverted to his recruitment agent back home, leaving him with £50 cash in hand each month – just £1.66 per day.

But his agent in India then told him to travel to a different meeting point in the south of England, and he was taken to the Noordzee. “I asked: ‘Why am I working there? It’s not my ship… I am not a fisherman'.” Vishal claims he was threatened with deportation if he didn’t comply. He spent three weeks on the trawler and says he was never paid.

The BBC has seen payment schedules given to both men upon employment. Both were to earn £850 per month, with an additional cash payment of £50. Based on a 48-hour working week, they would receive £4.68 an hour. The conditions they alleged were similar to those described to the BBC by the workers from 2012. “We were short of food and short of water,” says Gershon. He claimed deckhands would drink washing water from the ship’s rusty tank. When the tank was empty, they’d melt the ice used to pack the scallops. “We went to the fish room with a bucket or a sack and you put an ice block in… you put it on the stove… and the guys would make coffee with it.”\n",

Augustus, Gershon and Vishal, along with six other crew members from Ghana, India and Sri Lanka, were taken into the National Referral Mechanism system and recognised by the Home Office as victims of modern slavery. They were asked to stay in the UK as potential witnesses in the ongoing investigation into Thomas Nicholson Snr and TN Trawlers. After a five-year wait, the case was dropped after some of the men failed to identify suspects during an identity parade.

      "The Filipinos’ case finally reached Hamilton Sheriff Court in October 2022, some 10 years after the men were removed from the boats. Thomas Nicholson Snr and TN Trawlers pleaded guilty to failing to get adequate care for Joel Quince. The Crown accepted his not guilty plea to withholding some of the Filipino crewmen’s passports without reasonable excuse. Despite the Home Office’s conclusion that the men were trafficking victims, the case did not involve charges of trafficking or modern slavery. Thomas Nicholson Snr was fined £13,500 and ordered to pay Joel £3,000 in compensation. Text message exchanges between Nicholson Snr and the vessel’s skipper Tom Nicholson Jr on the day of the accident were read out in court, in which the father instructed his son not to take Joel ashore for medical treatment. After hearing the messages, Joel told the BBC: “He was a devil with a human image. He doesn’t see me as a person... he doesn’t see us.”\n",

      "Thomas Nicholson Snr was the director of TN Trawlers, TN Enterprises, Sea Lady Trawlers, and Olivia Jean. The companies owned at least six scallop dredgers. A spokesman for TN Group said it disputed suggestions that workers were mistreated. It said it always provided food and accommodation to workers and that they were “always free to come and go when ashore”. He said: “The overwhelming experience of our workers was that they were well treated and well remunerated. We dispute many of the accounts put to us, in some cases over a decade on. “We absolutely refute any allegation of modern slavery or human trafficking and our many testimonials and long-term employees are testament to that.\" He said the company regretted the delay in bringing Joel Quince ashore for medical treatment. “We fell short on that occasion. We have accepted responsibility, compensated and we apologise to that individual,” said the spokesman. “Working conditions on the high seas, sometimes in dangerous waters and in a confined environment, are extremely difficult.\"\n",

      "The Crown Office said it was fully committed to tackling human trafficking. “We recognise that the time taken in dealing with these complex and challenging matters has been difficult for those affected,” said a spokesperson. “COPFS deal with every case on its own individual facts and circumstances and takes action where it assesses there is sufficient admissible evidence that a crime has been committed and it is in the public interest to do so.” Life after TN Trawlers has seen mixed fortunes for its former crewmen. Many of those involved in Operation Alto have had their permission to remain in the UK extended, some indefinitely. This enables them to work in the UK and support their families – something they had always wanted. The men from Ghana interviewed by the BBC have seen their leave to remain expire, meaning they face the possibility of leaving the UK. However, all the men spoke of their bitterness at working for the company – and their experience of the justice system in the UK. Joel Quince said his eyes had been opened. “I see now how it works,” he said. “This is how your UK law is done... You favour the wealthy people, and you don’t care about the poor.”\n",

      "Getty Images Current typical annual bills for gas and electricity are at their lowest for two years\n",
      "\n",
      "Domestic energy prices are expected to rise in the run-up to winter, according to consultancy Cornwall Insight. The forecaster, which is widely regarded for its accurate predictions, said a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity would pay £1,714 a year from October. That would be a £146 a year rise compared with a current typical annual bill - the lowest for two years - of £1,568. Energy regulator Ofgem will announce the next official quarterly price cap on Friday, with charities concerned about the prospect of prices rising again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the price cap is changed every three months, it is illustrated by Ofgem in terms of an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. People in larger properties will tend to pay more overall owing to higher energy usage, and those in smaller properties will pay less. That is because the cap limits the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity, rather than the total bill. It affects 28 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. The sector is regulated separately in Northern Ireland. Cornwall Insight said prices paid by households, although protected to some degree by the price cap, were affected by volatility in the fragile global energy market. Wholesale costs, paid by suppliers, had risen by about 20% in the last few months, it said. These are reflected in consumer bills, accounting for about half of what customers pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "With prices set to rise, some billpayers might look at the options available to fix their energy tariff. Cornwall Insight said that the average saving from the top 10 cheapest tariffs on the market in August was only £5 a year, compared with a default tariff set by the price cap. That may change in the coming weeks, and Richard Neudegg, from price comparison website Uswitch, said there were options for those who wanted certainty. \"Just because it is a fix, it doesn't mean it is a good price fix,\" he said. \"The question for consumers is, if they want that level of certainty, how cheaply can they get it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncertainty ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "Cornwall Insight also said it expected costs to rise again during the winter, when the January price cap is announced. It said a \"modest\" rise was anticipated. However, recent tensions in the Russia-Ukraine war could see prices rise further, it added. \"While we don't expect a return to the extreme prices of recent years, it's unlikely that bills will return to what was once considered normal. Without significant intervention, this may well be the new normal,\" said Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at the forecaster. Charity National Energy Action said any increases in prices, alongside less support from the government, could stretch some households' finances \"beyond breaking point\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Standing charges, a fixed daily fee covering the costs of connecting to a supply, currently stand at at 60p a day for electricity and 31p a day for gas, although they vary by region. Ofgem is currently considering whether to change the standing charge billing system. Energy bills are considerably lower than the peak after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the government stepped in to limit bill rises, but are much higher than before the pandemic.\n",

The decision is part of efforts to pay off money the former glamour model owes under her two bankruptcies. A judge said on Monday that it was \"appropriate\" to order the \"suspension of further payments\" to Ms Price from the social media company while bankruptcy proceedings continue.

      "In January 2015, Abdullah, the 90-year-old king of Saudi Arabia, was dying in hospital. His half-brother, Salman, was about to become king – and Salman’s favourite son, Mohammed bin Salman, was preparing for power. The prince, known simply by his initials MBS and then just 29 years old, had big plans for his kingdom, the biggest plans in its history; but he feared that plotters within his own Saudi royal family could eventually move against him. So at midnight one evening that month, he summoned a senior security official to the palace, determined to win his loyalty. The official, Saad al-Jabri, was told to leave his mobile phone on a table outside. MBS did the same. The two men were now alone. The young prince was so fearful of palace spies that he pulled the socket out of the wall, disconnecting the only landline telephone. According to Jabri, MBS then talked about how he would wake his kingdom up from its deep slumber, allowing it to take its rightful place on the global stage. By selling a stake in the state oil producer Aramco, the world’s most profitable company, he would begin to wean his economy off its dependency on oil. He would invest billions in Silicon Valley tech startups including the taxi firm, Uber. Then, by giving Saudi women the freedom to join the workforce, he would create six million new jobs. Astonished, Jabri asked the prince about the extent of his ambition. “Have you heard of Alexander the Great?” came the simple reply. MBS ended the conversation there. A midnight meeting that was scheduled to last half-an-hour had gone on for three. Jabri left the room to find several missed calls on his mobile from government colleagues worried about his long disappearance.\n",

      "\n",
      "For the past year, our documentary team has been talking to both Saudi friends and opponents of MBS, as well as senior Western spies and diplomats. The Saudi government was given the opportunity to respond to the claims made in the BBC’s films and in this article. They chose not to do so. Saad al-Jabri was so high up in the Saudi security apparatus that he was friends with the heads of the CIA and MI6. While the Saudi government has called Jabri a discredited former official, he’s also the most well-informed Saudi dissident to have dared speak about how the crown prince rules Saudi Arabia – and the rare interview he has given us is astonishing in its detail. By gaining access to many who know the prince personally, we shed new light on the events that have made MBS notorious – including the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the launch of a devastating war in Yemen. With his father increasingly frail, the 38-year-old MBS is now de facto in charge of the birthplace of Islam and the world’s biggest exporter of oil. He’s begun to carry out many of the groundbreaking plans he described to Saad al-Jabri – while also being accused of human rights violations including the suppression of free speech, widespread use of the death penalty and jailing of women's rights activists.\n",

      "An inauspicious start\n",
      "\n",
      "The first king of Saudi Arabia fathered at least 42 sons, including MBS’s father, Salman. The crown has traditionally been passed down between these sons. It was when two of them suddenly died in 2011 and 2012 that Salman was elevated into the line of succession. Western spy agencies make it their business to study the Saudi equivalent of Kremlinology – working out who will be the next king. At this stage, MBS was so young and unknown that he wasn’t even on their radar. “He grew up in relative obscurity,” says Sir John Sawers, chief of MI6 until 2014. “He wasn’t earmarked to rise to power.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images Mohammed bin Salman always felt the need to prove himself among his fellow Saudi royals, according to a former UK offical\n",
      "\n",
      "The crown prince also grew up in a palace in which bad behaviour had few, if any, consequences; and that may help explain his notorious habit of not thinking through the impact of his decisions until he had already made them. MBS first achieved notoriety in Riyadh in his late teens, when he was nicknamed “Abu Rasasa” or “Father of the Bullet”, after allegedly sending a bullet in the post to a judge who had overruled him in a property dispute. “He has had a certain ruthlessness,” observes Sir John Sawers. “He doesn’t like to be crossed. But that also means he’s been able to drive through changes that no other Saudi leader has been able to do.” Among the most welcome changes, the former MI6 chief says, has been cutting off Saudi funding to overseas mosques and religious schools that became breeding grounds for Islamist jihadism – at huge benefit to the safety of the West. MBS’s mother, Fahda, is a Bedouin tribeswoman and seen as the favourite of his father’s four wives. Western diplomats believe the king has suffered for many years from a slow-onset form of vascular dementia; and MBS was the son he turned to for help. Several diplomats recalled for us their meetings with MBS and his father. The prince would write notes on an iPad, then send them to his father’s iPad, as a way of prompting what he would say next. “Inevitably I wondered whether MBS was typing out his lines for him,” recalls Lord Kim Darroch, National Security Adviser to David Cameron when he was British prime minister. The prince was apparently so impatient for his father to become king that in 2014, he reportedly suggested killing the then-monarch – Abdullah, his uncle – with a poisoned ring, obtained from Russia. “I don’t know for sure if he was just bragging, but we took it seriously,” says Jabri. The former senior security official says he has seen a secretly recorded surveillance video of MBS talking about the idea. “He was banned from court, from shaking hands with the king, for a considerable amount of time.” In the event, the king died of natural causes, allowing his brother, Salman, to assume the throne in 2015. MBS was appointed Defence Minister and lost no time in going to war.\n",
      "\n",
      "War in Yemen\n",
      "\n",
      "Two months later, the prince led a Gulf coalition into war against the Houthi movement, which had seized control of much of western Yemen and which he saw as a proxy of Saudi Arabia’s regional rival Iran. It triggered a humanitarian disaster, with millions on the brink of famine. “It wasn’t a clever decision,” says Sir John Jenkins, who was British ambassador just before the war began. “One senior American military commander told me they had been given 12 hours’ notice of the campaign, which is unheard of.” The military campaign helped turn a little-known prince into a Saudi national hero. However, it was also the first of what even his friends believe have been several major mistakes. A recurring pattern of behaviour was emerging: MBS’s tendency to jettison the traditionally slow and collegiate system of Saudi decision-making, preferring to act unpredictably or upon impulse; and refusing to kowtow to the US, or be treated as head of a backward client state. Jabri goes much further, accusing MBS of forging his father the king’s signature on a royal decree committing ground troops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jabri says he discussed the Yemen war in the White House before it started; and that Susan Rice, President Obama’s National Security Advisor, warned him that the US would only support an air campaign. However, Jabri claims MBS was so determined to press ahead in Yemen that he ignored the Americans. “We were surprised that there was a royal decree to allow the ground interventions,” Jabri says. “He forged the signature of his dad for that royal decree. The king’s mental capacity was deteriorating.” Jabri says his source for this allegation was “credible, reliable” and linked to the Ministry of Interior where he was chief of staff. Jabri recalls the CIA station chief in Riyadh telling him how angry he was that MBS had ignored the Americans, adding that the invasion of Yemen should never have happened. The former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers says that while he doesn’t know if MBS forged the documents, “it is clear that this was MBS’s decision to intervene militarily in Yemen. It wasn’t his father’s decision, although his father was carried along with it.” We’ve discovered that MBS saw himself as an outsider from the very beginning - a young man with much to prove and a refusal to obey anybody’s rules other than his own. Kirsten Fontenrose, who served on President Donald Trump’s National Security Council, says that when she read the CIA’s in-house psychological profile of the prince, she felt it missed the point. “There were no prototypes to base him on,” she says. “He has had unlimited resources. He has never been told ‘no’. He is the first young leader to reflect a generation that, frankly, most of us in government are too old to understand.”\n",

      "MBS’s purchase of a famous painting in 2017 tells us much about how he thinks, and his willingness to be a risk-taker, unafraid to be out of step with the religiously conservative society that he governs. And above all, determined to outplay the West in conspicuous displays of power. In 2017, a Saudi prince reportedly acting for MBS spent $450m (£350m) on the Salvator Mundi, which remains the world’s most expensive work of art ever sold. The portrait, reputed to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci, depicts Jesus Christ as master of heaven and Earth, the saviour of the world. For almost seven years, ever since the auction, it has completely disappeared.\n",

      "Bernard Haykel, a friend of the crown prince and Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, says that despite rumours that it hangs in the prince's yacht or palace, the painting is actually in storage in Geneva and that MBS intends to hang it in a museum in the Saudi capital that has not yet been built. “I want to build a very large museum in Riyadh,” Haykel quotes MBS as saying. “And I want an anchor object that will attract people, just like the Mona Lisa does.” Similarly, his plans for sport reflect someone who is both hugely ambitious and unafraid to disrupt the status quo. Saudi Arabia’s incredible spending spree on world-class sport – it is the sole bidder to host the FIFA World Cup in 2034, and has made multimillion-dollar investments in staging tournaments for tennis and golf – has been called “sportswashing”. But what we found is a leader who cares less about what the West thinks of him than he does about demonstrating the opposite: that he will do whatever he wants in the name of making himself and Saudi Arabia great. “MBS is interested in building his own power as a leader,” says Sir John Sawers, the former Chief of MI6, who has met him. “And the only way he can do that is by building his country’s power. That’s what’s driving him.” Jabri’s 40-year career as a Saudi official did not survive MBS’s consolidation of power. Chief of staff for the former Crown Prince Muhammed bin Nayef, he fled the kingdom as MBS was taking over, after being tipped off by a foreign intelligence service that he could be in danger. But Jabri says MBS texted him out of the blue, offering him his old job back. “It was bait – and I didn’t bite,” Jabri says, convinced he would have been tortured, imprisoned or killed if he returned. As it was, his teenage children, Omar and Sarah, were detained and later jailed for money laundering and for trying to escape – charges that they deny. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has called for their release. “He planned for my assassination,” Jabri says. “He will not rest until he sees me dead, I have no doubt about that.” Saudi officials have issued Interpol notices for Jabri’s extradition from Canada, without success. They claim he is wanted for corruption involving billions of dollars during his time at the interior ministry. However, he was given the rank of major-general and credited by the CIA and MI6 with helping to prevent al-Qaeda terrorist attacks.\n",

      "Khashoggi’s killing\n",
      "\n",
      "The killing of Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 implicates MBS in ways that are very hard to refute. The 15-strong hit squad was travelling on diplomatic passports and included several of MBS’s own bodyguards. Khashoggi’s body has never been found and is believed to have been hacked into pieces with a bone saw. Professor Haykel exchanged WhatsApp messages with MBS not long after the murder. “I was asking, ‘how could this happen?’,” Haykel recalls. “I think he was in deep shock. He didn’t realise the reaction to this was going to be as deep.” Dennis Ross met MBS shortly afterwards. “He said he didn’t do it and that it was a colossal blunder,” says Ross. “I certainly wanted to believe him, because I couldn’t believe that he could authorise something [like] that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi had criticised the policies of MBS\n",
      "\n",
      "MBS has always denied knowledge of the plot, although in 2019 he said he took “responsibility\" because the crime happened on his watch. A declassified US intelligence report released in February 2021 asserted that he was complicit in the killing of Khashoggi. I asked those who know MBS personally whether he had learned from his mistakes; or whether having survived the Khashoggi affair, it had in fact emboldened him. “He’s learned lessons the hard way,” says Professor Haykel, who says MBS resents the case being used as cudgel against him and his country, but that a killing like Khashoggi’s would not happen again. Sir John Sawers cautiously agrees that the murder was a turning point. “I think he has learned some lessons. The personality, though, remains the same.” His father, King Salman, is now aged 88. When he dies, MBS could rule Saudi Arabia for the next 50 years. However, he has recently admitted he fears being assassinated, possibly as a consequence of his attempts to normalise Saudi-Israeli ties. “I think there are lots of people who want to kill him,” says Professor Haykel, “and he knows it.” Eternal vigilance is what keeps a man like MBS safe. It was what Saad al-Jabri observed at the beginning of the prince’s rise to power, when he pulled the telephone socket out of the wall before speaking to him in his palace. MBS is still a man on a mission to modernise his country, in ways his predecessors would never have dared. But he’s also not the first autocrat who runs the risk of being so ruthless that nobody around him dares prevent him from making more mistakes.

      "PA Ted Baker started out as a menswear brand in Glasgow in 1988\n",
      "\n",
      "Ted Baker - a fixture on UK High Streets since the late 1980s - is the latest casualty in the battle facing brick-and-mortar shops. Known for its quirky advertising and signature floral prints, the brand has long been synonymous with British fashion and heritage. But in recent years, it has faced huge challenges such as fierce competition, the shift to online shopping and the departure of its founder Ray Kelvin. It is now set to close its remaining stores this week, putting more than 500 jobs at risk in the UK. \"This is an iconic brand with a signature design,\" Diane Wehrle, retail expert and chief executive at Rendle Intelligence and Insights told the BBC. During the brand's 36-year history, it has been forced to compete with other, higher-end, High Street fashion outfits such as Reiss, Whistles, Mango and Massimo Dutti, \"all of which have eaten away at its market share\", she noted. It has had to fend off competition while facing huge overheads with some 1,000 employees across 46 stores, concessions and the online business, she said. But its fatal error? A failure to evolve with consumer tastes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "'Too tired' for shoppers\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Over the last three decades their signature floral design, whilst iconic, simply became too tired for current consumers,\" Ms Wehrle said. According to Ms Wehrle, the brand's \"instability and poor media profile\" has also been exacerbated by allegations of misconduct against its founder, further impacting sales. Founder Ray Kelvin stepped down as chief executive in March 2019 after allegations of inappropriate behaviour, which he denied. His successor Lindsay Page and chairman David Bernstein then resigned in late 2019 after the firm issued a profit warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ted Baker started out as a menswear brand in Glasgow in 1988. Eventually, it had set up shops all across the UK and in the United States, with licensing agreements in place for stores in cities in Asia and the Middle East. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, told the BBC that Ted Baker achieved massive success in the nineties and noughties, by creating highly sought-after product for special occasions. \"Teenage boys bought their first suits for prom, twenty-something women picked up signature florals to wear at friend’s wedding and Christmas stockings were packed full of branded fragrances and lotions,\" she said. But she suggests its charm began to fade as its footprint expanded, and once consumers recognised in lockdown that they could opt for athleisure instead of being \"suited and booted\", it struggled to stand out.\n",
      "\n",
      "EPA\n",
      "\n",
      "“Retail is brutal and fashion retail particularly so,\" she said. \"What strikes a chord with shoppers one season might be off key the next and social media has made being 'on trend' even more important\". Plenty of other names have seen similar struggles. Although the likes of Karen Millen and Coast still exist as part of bigger online stables, they don’t have the same brand recognition they once did. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that while bigger operations like Next and M&S were able to \"switch focus\" to establish digital channels and more laid-back ranges, \"Ted Baker floundered as the company failed to shift gears\". She said that when Authentic Brands Group snapped up Ted Baker in 2022, there were \"high hopes of a revival, but the investment needed to rejuvenate the brand didn’t materialise\". The cost-of-living squeeze has also squeezed customers' budgets in another blow for brands positioning themselves in the middle of the market.\n",

      "\n",
      "With just three months to go before the 2024 election, thousands are set to gather in Chicago this week for the Democratic National Convention. It’s a tradition dating back to the 1830s, when a group of Democratic delegates supporting President Andrew Jackson gathered in Baltimore to nominate him for a second term. This year will look slightly different from others, as the Democratic Party has already officially nominated Vice-President Kamala Harris in a virtual roll call after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. But many of the other DNC traditions - including appearances from celebrities and memorable speeches from party leaders - will remain the same. Here’s what to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "When and where is the DNC?\n",
      "\n",
      "This year’s convention is taking place at the United Center Arena in Chicago from Monday 19 August to Thursday 22 August.\n",

      "Getty Images Around 50,000 people are coming to Chicago for the DNC\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens at the DNC?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because Ms Harris and Mr Walz have already been nominated, this year’s convention will focus on speeches from prominent Democrats and the adoption of the party’s platform. Delegates work during the day to finalise the platform, a draft of which has already been released. It focuses on a broad range of issues, including plans to lower inflation, mitigate climate change and tackle gun violence. In the draft, Democrats contrast each of the party positions with Project 2025, an ultra-conservative blueprint for what a second Trump administration could look like, authored by the Heritage Foundation. Trump has sought to distance himself from the project, though several of his allies were involved in writing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who will be speaking?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dozens of prominent Democrats and celebrities will be taking the stage in Chicago. President Biden will headline the convention on Monday night, and his record will be honoured throughout the evening. The crowd will also hear from First Lady Jill Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Maryland Rep Jamie Raskin, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other Democratic leaders. Americans affected by abortion bans in Republican-controlled states and voices from the labour movement - including United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain - will be heard as well. The first evening of the DNC will \"showcase Kamala Harris’s commitment to fighting for everyday Americans\" with a particular focus on \"freedom\", DNC officials told reporters. On Tuesday, former President Barack Obama is expected to deliver remarks, as is former First Lady Michelle Obama. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Ms Harris’s husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, will also address the convention on Tuesday. Wednesday’s line-up reportedly features former President Bill Clinton and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, among others. Ms Harris’s running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will give the prime-time speech that night after his nomination. The most important night of the convention is Thursday, when Vice-President Harris will take the stage. She will formally accept the presidential nomination and give her speech on the final night of the convention dedicated \"For the Future.\" Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries will also take the stage at some point during the week. Famous politicians aren’t the only ones who will make an appearance. The convention will also hear from several everyday Americans, including Trump voters.\n",

      "Who else will be in attendance?\n",
      "\n",
      "AFP\n",
      "\n",
      "Around 50,000 people are expected to attend this year’s convention in Chicago. This includes thousands of delegates chosen by state Democratic parties as well as super delegates, who are major elected officials, notable members of the Democratic Party and some members of the Democratic National Committee. Thousands of members of the media will also be in attendance. It will be a star-studded convention with appearances from several celebrities. In 2020, actors Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Eva Longoria attended the convention, while Elizabeth Banks and America Ferrera appeared in 2016. Rumours have swirled about whether mega-stars Beyoncé and Taylor Swift will attend this year, but neither has actually confirmed they will be there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will there be protests?\n",
      "\n",
      "Demonstrations are planned for outside the DNC venue, many of which are centred around opposition to US support of Israel’s war in Gaza. Organisers have said as many as 10,000 people could take part in marches. Protesters have been haggling with the city of Chicago about where they can demonstrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can I follow coverage?\n",
      "\n",
      "Members of the public can only attend the convention in person by becoming volunteers. But as with the Republican convention, there will be plenty of national media coverage, and the convention itself will offer live-streams on social media platforms. You'll be able to follow BBC News coverage - featuring on-site reporting and analysis - across the website and app, and on our live-stream.

      "\n",
      "PA Media Adriana Orme was the second woman from Worcestershire to be charged over the monkey torture ring\n",
      "\n",
      "A woman has pleaded guilty to being involved in a global monkey torturing ring. Adriana Orme's role was exposed after a BBC investigation into the network, which began life on YouTube, before moving to private groups on the messaging app Telegram. Worcester Crown Court heard that the 56-year-old played a major role in an online group that paid for baby monkeys to be taken from their mothers, then tortured, and killed, for pleasure. Orme, from Upton Upon Severn, Worcestershire, was charged with publishing an obscene article and intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence, namely causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warning: This article contains disturbing content BBC journalists went undercover in one of the main Telegram torture groups, where hundreds of people gathered to come up with extreme torture ideas and commission people in Indonesia and other Asian countries to carry them out. The goal was to create bespoke films in which baby long-tailed macaque monkeys were abused, tortured and sometimes then killed on film. In relation to the charge of publishing an obscene article, Orme was accused of sending one image and 26 videos featuring monkey torture into chat groups, between 14 March 2022 and 16 June 2022. The charge of encouraging an offence involved a £10 payment by Orme to a PayPal account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orme was arrested in 2022, following the BBC Eye investigation\n",
      "\n",
      "Orme is the second woman from the area to admit her part in the gang, alongside 37-year-old Holly Le Gresley, from Kidderminster, who admitted uploading 22 images and 132 videos of monkeys being tortured to online chat groups in May. Their part in the network was uncovered by a year-long BBC Eye investigation, which exposed the private online groups. The court heard how Orme was a \"key member\" of the groups, welcoming newcomers and organising the bids. Police said members, based around the world, would discuss different ways in which the monkeys could be abused and killed, voting and paying for their favoured methods of torture. Men in Indonesia were taking the monkeys from their families in the wild and carrying out the abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ch Insp Kevin Lacks-Kelly, head of the UK National Wildlife Crime Unit, said it was the worst case that he had dealt with during his 22 years as an officer. \"We’ve seen the worst that humanity can bring,\" he said. \"The animals in this case have been unnecessarily tortured, there's no excuse for it. \"I can't offer any rationale or reason as to why somebody would want to go to the levels that they went to, to persecute, kill, harm and maim these innocent animals.\"\n",

      "The Scottish government has announced it will not hold any more meetings with Israeli ambassadors until \"real progress\" is made in peace talks over the Gaza conflict.

Police were called to Barnard Road in Gorton at about 23:20 BST on Sunday after reports three people had been stabbed. The woman died at the scene while a 17-year-old girl and a 64-year-old man were taken to hospital for treatment.

Plain-clothed officers have been seen knocking on doors, while others in white overalls and protective clothing have been seen in the road. One person, who lives within the cordon, told BBC Radio Manchester he woke up to hear a \"lot of screaming and noises\".

      "PA Media Doug Beattie became the leader of the UUP in May 2021\n",
      "\n",
      "Doug Beattie has resigned as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). In a statement, he cited \"irreconcilable differences\" between him and party officers. Mr Beattie took over as leader of the party in May 2021. It is understood there have been internal tensions over his role in recent weeks linked to the selection of Colin Crawford as the party’s new North Antrim assembly member.\n",
      "\n",
      "After several difficult electoral performances, the party regained a seat at Westminster in July's general election. Robin Swann's election as MP for South Antrim left his Northern Ireland Assembly seat empty which was filled by Mr Crawford. In his statement, Mr Beattie said leading the party had been an honour and said there had been \"small successes on the back of difficult electoral results with a lot of work still to do\". \"It is now clear that some believe the momentum needed to keep the Ulster Unionist Party moving in the right direction cannot come from me,\" he said. \"Irreconcilable differences between myself and party officers combined with the inability to influence and shape the party going forward means that I can no longer remain the party leader.\" He said the UUP would immediately begin the process of selecting a new leader. The UUP has had three leaders - including Mr Beattie - since Mike Nesbitt resigned in the aftermath of the 2017 assembly election.\n",

      "Mr Beattie cut a happy figure at the general election count, when his party won a seat for the first time since 2015\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Beattie added in his statement that leading the UUP had been at times \"lonely and isolating\". \"I am no stranger to leadership and that is how it often feels in taking a toll both physically and mentally,\" he said. \"It also strains friendships and political relationships.\" He said that while many colleagues had shown \"loyalty and support\" there were others who \"did not agree with the direction and path I set for the party and the vision I promoted\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Who is Doug Beattie?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Beattie took over as leader of the UUP in May 2021. The party has experienced a tough time in elections since it was surpassed by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) at the Stormont poll in 2003 and the Westminster election of 2005. But in the months following Mr Beattie's election as leader, the UUP overtook the DUP in opinion polls. The \"Beattie bounce\" did not last and the UUP subsequently had challenging local and assembly polls, although it did win a seat in the House of Commons in the 2024 general election. In January 2022 he faced a crisis after accusations of misogyny and racism over a number of his historical tweets. He said the tweets were \"pretty horrific\" and that he was ashamed by them, but denied being a racist or misogynist. Party MLAs and officers later backed him remaining as leader. Mr Beattie was born on an Army base in Hampshire and later became a soldier. In 2005 he was commissioned as an officer at the rank of captain and served three tours of duty in Afghanistan. For his actions in fierce fighting over several days in September 2006 he was awarded the Military Cross - the third-highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy.\n",

The years have diminished the party in many ways but the description still stands. Just witness the demise of Doug Beattie as the latest to try - and fail - to return the party to former glories. He breezed in promising a vision of “A Union of People”. He couldn’t even manage a union of his own party, which – though we don’t hear as much about the schisms as we did in the UUP of old – they clearly still exist. Read more here.\n",
